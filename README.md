# Student-Compass
General student services app for my web dev course at uni.

In this project I used the basic techniques to imlement front-end by using Css/Bootstrap, Express Handlebars for view handling and Javascript for functionality.
Back end has been implemented on Mongodb using mongoose, with password encryption and cookies to create sessions and Node.js.

The general purpose of this app:
User-side(student) -- view news/announcements at homepage, declare courses to take with updating weekly schedule, modidy profile settings.
Admin-side(staff) -- post/delete announcements, arrange course schedule add/remove courses from syllabus.
